Set up base types and constants:
Define integration types from existing INTEGRATIONS constant
Create MODULE_ENABLED_INTEGRATIONS constant and related types
Define helper types for type safety

Create module folder structure:
One folder per module (e.g., salesReceipts/)
Include components/, schemas/, types/, config/ subfolders
Create index.ts for clean exports

Define module-level configuration:

Create integration-specific feature sets
Define feature availability per integration
Add helper methods for feature checking

Connect to form system:
Update step registry to use new configuration
Add conditional rendering based on integration type
Implement validation based on enabled features

Add type safety layers:
Ensure configurations are provided for all enabled integrations
Prevent configurations for disabled integrations
Type guard runtime checks
